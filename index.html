    <h1>Des Sens</h1>
    <p>See clearly. Feel fully. Live authentically.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>The Concept</h2>
    <p>
      Des Sens is more than a brand—it's a philosophy. Rooted in perception, authenticity, and truth, it invites you to live intentionally, through your senses, and embrace life as a series of deeply felt, meaningful moments. It’s about cultivating a connection with what is real, enduring, and truly essential.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p><i>La vie est une condition des sens.</i></p>
    <p>
      Life happens through perception. That’s all we have: what we see, what we feel, what we touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Des Sens was born from that realization. It’s not a brand or a project. It’s a philosophy, a way of understanding the world. To live authentically is to embrace both beauty and imperfection. To find depth in the ordinary. To stop waiting for the perfect moment and instead create meaning in this one.
    </p>
    <h3>Core Principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>La Vérité:</b> Truth isn’t shiny or perfect. It’s raw, sometimes uncomfortable, but always real. It’s found in depth, not distractions.</li>
      <li><b>L’Authentique:</b> Life doesn’t have to be polished. The most beautiful things are honest, imperfect, and deeply human.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Manifesto</h2>
    <p>Des Sens is an invitation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To slow down.</li>
      <li>To see clearly.</li>
      <li>To feel deeply.</li>
      <li>To find meaning in the ordinary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Life isn’t found in the endless pursuit of more—it’s in the textures, the colors, the moments that ground us in ourselves and the world around us.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>A Story, Not a Product</h2>
    <p>
      Des Sens doesn’t want to sell you anything. There’s no pitch, no call to action, no list of benefits. This is about creating something timeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The things we carry should mean something. A sweater that feels like home. A notebook where your thoughts can live. A cup that holds more than coffee—it holds your mornings, your reflections, your stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s not about the objects. It’s about what they hold. The memories, the weight of time, the life they carry with you.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Aesthetic</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Materials:</b> Natural. Honest. Wool, linen, leather—things that feel real under your hands.</li>
      <li><b>Colors:</b> Soft whites, earthy browns, deep blues. Colors that ground you, that don’t try to be anything more than they are.</li>
      <li><b>Details:</b> Imperfections. Loose threads, hand-stitched edges, the texture of something made slowly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Everything is designed to fade into your life, not demand space in it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Des Sens isn’t about things. It’s about creating a world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A world where presence matters more than productivity. Where you wake up and feel alive—not because you have everything, but because you notice everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s about seeing clearly. Feeling fully. Living authentically.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this resonates with you, then welcome. Des Sens is already yours.
